/*
- Tests will pass even if the SVG is not valid, as the test only checks for the presence of a string in the output.
- Tests will fail for minor, irrelevant changes to the string, such as an extra space between attributes.
- The primary issue is testing a data structure (XML) by examining its string representation.
- Testing XML as a string leads to fragile tests that are not sufficiently sensitive.
- This approach results in tests that do not accurately test the intended functionality.
