// The syntax for declaring methods is almost the same as functions and that's because they're so similar.
// The only difference is the syntax of the method receiver `func (receiverName ReceiverType) MethodName(args)`.

// When your method is called on a variable of that type, you get your reference to its data via the `receiverName` variable.
// In many other programming languages this is done implicitly and you access the receiver via `this`.

// It is a convention in Go to have the receiver variable be the first letter of the type.
