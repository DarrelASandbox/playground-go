It is important to question the value of your tests. It should not be a goal to have as many tests as possible, but rather to have as much confidence as possible in your code base. Having too many tests can turn in to a real problem and it just adds more overhead in maintenance. Every test has a cost.

# Structs

Declaring structs to create your own data types which lets you bundle related data together and make the intent of your code clearer

Declaring interfaces so you can define functions that can be used by different types (parametric polymorphism)

Adding methods so you can add functionality to your data types and so you can implement interfaces

[Table driven tests](https://go.dev/wiki/TableDrivenTests) to make your assertions clearer and your test suites easier to extend & maintain

At some point you may wish to use structs to manage state, exposing methods to let users change the state in a way that you can control.

Pointers to struct have their own name: struct pointers and they are [automatically dereferenced](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Method_values)

# Pointers

Go copies values when you pass them to functions/methods, so if you're writing a function that needs to mutate state you'll need it to take a pointer to the thing you want to change.

The fact that Go takes a copy of values is useful a lot of the time but sometimes you won't want your system to make a copy of something, in which case you need to pass a reference. Examples include referencing very large data structures or things where only one instance is necessary (like database connection pools).

# nil

Pointers can be nil

When a function returns a pointer to something, you need to make sure you check if it's nil or you might raise a runtime exception - the compiler won't help you here.

Useful for when you want to describe a value that could be missing
