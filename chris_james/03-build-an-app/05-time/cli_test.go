		- We remove our dummy for StdIn and instead send in a mocked version representing our user entering 7

		While our new test has been fixed, a lot of others have failed because now our system only works if the game starts with a user entering a number. You'll need to fix the tests by changing the user inputs so that a number followed by a newline is added (this is highlighting yet more flaws in our approach right now).
